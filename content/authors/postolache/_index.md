I am a Ph.D. student interested in generative models, especially applied to (waveform) compositional music generation. I also worked on source separation, foley sound synthesis, EEG music decoding and machine translation. I pursued internships at Dolby Laboratories, SonyCSL Tokyo and visited the Center For Digital Music in Queen Mary University of London.

abstract: "While biological intelligence grows organically as new knowledge is gathered throughout life, Artificial Neural Networks forget catastrophically whenever they face a changing training data distribution. Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) approaches have been established as a versatile and reliable solution to overcome this limitation; however, sudden input disruptions and memory constraints are known to alter the consistency of their predictions. We study this phenomenon by investigating the geometric characteristics of the learnerâ€™s latent space and find that replayed data points of different classes increasingly mix up, interfering with classification. Hence, we propose a geometric regularizer that enforces weak requirements on the Laplacian spectrum of the latent space, promoting a partitioning behavior. Our proposal, called Continual Spectral Regularizer for Incremental Learning (CaSpeR-IL), can be easily combined with any rehearsal-based CL approach and improves the performance of SOTA methods on standard benchmarks."

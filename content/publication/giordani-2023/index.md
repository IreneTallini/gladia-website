abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a non-universal model for quantum computing
  inspired by the original formulation of the Boson Sampling (BS) problem. Nowadays,
  it represents a paradigmatic quantum platform to reach the quantum advantage regime
  in a specific computational model. Indeed, thanks to the implementation in photonics-based
  processors, the latest GBS experiments have reached a level of complexity where
  the quantum apparatus has solved the task faster than currently up-to-date classical
  strategies. In addition, recent studies have identified possible applications beyond
  the inherent sampling task. In particular, a direct connection between photon counting
  of a genuine GBS device and the number of perfect matchings in a graph has been
  established. In this work, we propose to exploit such a connection to benchmark
  GBS experiments. We interpret the properties of the feature vectors of the graph
  encoded in the device as a signature of correct sampling from the true input state.
  Within this framework, two approaches are presented. The first method exploits the
  distributions of graph feature vectors and classification via neural networks. The
  second approach investigates the distributions of graph kernels. Our results provide
  a novel approach to the actual need for tailored algorithms to benchmark large-scale
  Gaussian Boson Samplers.

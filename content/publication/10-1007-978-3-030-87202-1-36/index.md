abstract: Patient-specific Biomechanical Models (PBMs) can enhance computer assisted
  surgical procedures with critical information. Although pre-operative data allow
  to parametrize such PBMs based on each patient's properties, they are not able to
  fully characterize them. In particular, simulation boundary conditions cannot be
  determined from pre-operative modalities, but their correct definition is essential
  to improve the PBM predictive capability. In this work, we introduce a pipeline
  that provides an up-to-date estimate of boundary conditions, starting from the pre-operative
  model of patient anatomy and the displacement undergone by points visible from an
  intra-operative vision sensor. The presented pipeline is experimentally validated
  in realistic conditions on an ex vivo pararenal fat tissue manipulation. We demonstrate
  its capability to update a PBM reaching clinically acceptable performances, both
  in terms of accuracy and intra-operative time constraints.

abstract: "We consider the problem of minimum distortion intrinsic correspondence between deformable shapes, many useful formulations of which give rise to the NP-hard quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Previous attempts to use the spectral relaxation have had limited success due to the lack of sparsity of the obtained 'fuzzy' solution. In this paper, we adopt the recently introduced alternative L_1 relaxation of the QAP based on the principles of game theory. We relate it to the Gromov and Lipschitz metrics between metric spaces and demonstrate on state-of-the-art benchmarks that the proposed approach is capable of finding very accurate sparse correspondences between deformable shapes."

abstract: "We propose Anisotropic Windowed Fourier Transform (AWFT), a framework for localized space-frequency analysis of deformable 3D shapes. With AWFT, we are able to extract meaningful intrinsic localized orientation-sensitive structures on surfaces, and use them in applications such as shape segmentation, salient point detection, feature point description, and matching. Our method outperforms previous approaches in the considered applications."

abstract: "This paper presents Fauno, the first and largest open-source Italian conversational Large Language Model (LLM). Our goal with Fauno is to democratize the study of LLMs in Italian, demonstrating that obtaining a fine-tuned conversational bot with a single GPU is possible. In addition, we release a collection of datasets for conversational AI in Italian. The datasets on which we fine-tuned Fauno include various topics such as general question answering, computer science, and medical questions."

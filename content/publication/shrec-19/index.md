abstract: "Objects Matching is a ubiquitous problem in computer science with particular relevance for many applications; property transfer between 3D models and statistical study for learning are just some remarkable examples. The research community spent a lot of effort to address this problem, and a large and increased set of innovative methods has been proposed for its solution. In order to provide a fair comparison among these methods, different benchmarks have been proposed. However, all these benchmarks are domain specific, e.g., real scans coming from the same acquisition pipeline, or synthetic watertight meshes with the same triangulation. To the best of our knowledge, no cross-dataset comparisons have been proposed to date. This track provides the first matching evaluation in terms of large connectivity changes between models that come from totally different modeling methods. We provide a dataset of 44 shapes with dense correspondence as obtained by a highly accurate shape registration method (FARM). Our evaluation proves that connectivity changes lead to Objects Matching difficulties and we hope this will promote further research in matching shapes with wildly different connectivity."

abstract: "This paper describes the UNITOR system that participated to the Irony
  Detection in Italian Tweets task (IronITA) within the context of EvalIta 2018.
  The system corresponds to a cascade of Support Vector Machine classifiers.
  Specific features and kernel functions have been proposed to tackle the
  different subtasks: Irony Classification and Sarcasm Classification. The
  proposed system ranked first in the Sarcasm Detection subtask (out of 7
  submissions), while it ranked sixth (out of 17 submissions) in the Irony
  Detection task"

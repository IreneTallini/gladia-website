abstract: 'We introduce a novel computational framework for digital geometry processing,
  based upon the derivation of a nonlinear operator associated to the total variation
  functional. Such an operator admits a generalized notion of spectral decomposition,
  yielding a convenient multiscale representation akin to Laplacian-based methods,
  while at the same time avoiding undesirable over-smoothing effects typical of such
  techniques. Our approach entails accurate, detail-preserving decomposition and manipulation
  of 3D shape geometry while taking an especially intuitive form: non-local semantic
  details are well separated into different bands, which can then be filtered and
  re-synthesized with a straightforward linear step. Our computational framework is
  flexible, can be applied to a variety of signals, and is easily adapted to different
  geometry representations, including triangle meshes and point clouds. We showcase
  our method through multiple applications in graphics, ranging from surface and signal
  denoising to enhancement, detail transfer, and cubic stylization.'
